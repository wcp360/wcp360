# Portainer environment interoperability

This is an optional premium connector proposal, not an implemented or installable package. Its current state is **design**, **not installable**, with the source distribution model **undecided**.

Prepare selected Portainer environment inventory and explicitly scoped interoperability through an admitted Core integration.

## Proposal record

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Local proposal ID | `plugin.portainer-management-pro` |
| Kind / tier | `plugin` / `pro` |
| Category | `compute-platforms` |
| Core owners | [Platform](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/Platform/README.md), [Operations](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/Operations/README.md), [Tenancy](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/Tenancy/README.md) |
| Existing catalogue keys | `compute.containers`, `compute.node-groups` |
| Package dependencies | None selected; Core owners are contract boundaries, not package dependencies. |
| Authority | [CATALOG.json](../CATALOG.json); [this JSON mirror](package.proposal.json) must remain identical to its entry. |

Catalogue keys refer to the [existing 149-entry design catalogue](../../../PLUGIN_CATALOG.md). A local proposal ID is not a production manifest ID, provider qualification, publisher identity or Core admission record.

## Core boundary

Portainer-managed resources remain externally owned until an explicit import/handoff is authorized. Its Docker/Kubernetes proxy is not delegated to the plugin; native Core Docker controls remain free. This is a design-only connector proposal. Essential hosting, current actor and tenant authorization, native service drivers and recovery remain in the free Core. No production interface, publisher trust, installation or effectful capability is established by this metadata.

## Intended scope and evidence

1. Qualify a selected Portainer product/API profile with per-user token permissions, exact environment/team/resource ownership and bounded redacted inventory.
2. Refuse raw Docker/Kubernetes passthrough, arbitrary stack/Compose inputs and mutation of resources actively controlled by Core; any operation needs a separate admitted use case.
3. Exercise revoked access, stale inventory, partial external changes and retained-volume recovery; disabling the connector must not remove environments or stop hosted workloads.
4. Declare observation-only, import or externally managed ownership before any integration request. Refuse competing writers for Core-owned resources; ownership handoff requires an authorized inventory, admission review and recovery plan.

The complete [acceptance record](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md) defines evidence still required. No checks are marked complete, and no SDK/provider version, target compatibility, release artifact or production entitlement is selected.

## Packaging and licensing decisions

Only this README, the [proposal metadata](package.proposal.json) and [acceptance document](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md) belong to this draft. Executable source, configuration, lifecycle providers and a production manifest must accompany a concrete reviewed implementation later.

The Core license is [AGPL-3.0-only](../../../WCP360_Core/LICENSING.md). This proposal does not choose the connector's license, price, source distribution model, key or vendor URL. A process/API boundary does not automatically permit a proprietary derivative. Review [editions and premium boundaries](../../../documentation/development/EDITIONS-AND-PREMIUM.md) and [plugin lifecycle requirements](../../../documentation/development/PLUGIN-LIFECYCLE.md).

## Upstream evidence and qualification limits

Official documentation reviewed for this proposal identifies upstream interfaces and constraints. It does not select an executable artifact, supported release or OS/API matrix, nor establish WCP360 compatibility. Recheck provenance, current maintenance and the selected profile before implementation or admission.
