# PagerDuty incident and on-call connector

This is an optional premium connector proposal, not an implemented or installable package. Its current state is **design**, **not installable**, with the source distribution model **undecided**.

Prepare incident-event delivery and authorized acknowledgement reconciliation for selected PagerDuty services.

## Proposal record

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Local proposal ID | `plugin.pagerduty-oncall-pro` |
| Kind / tier | `plugin` / `pro` |
| Category | `collaboration-support` |
| Core owners | [Observability](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/Observability/README.md), [Operations](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/Operations/README.md), [IdentityAccess](../../../WCP360_Core/src/Module/IdentityAccess/README.md) |
| Existing catalogue keys | `notify.oncall` |
| Package dependencies | None selected; Core owners are contract boundaries, not package dependencies. |
| Authority | [CATALOG.json](../CATALOG.json); [this JSON mirror](package.proposal.json) must remain identical to its entry. |

Catalogue keys refer to the [existing 149-entry design catalogue](../../../PLUGIN_CATALOG.md). A local proposal ID is not a production manifest ID, provider qualification, publisher identity or Core admission record.

## Core boundary

Incident status does not authorize host remediation; local incident evidence and service recovery remain Core-owned. This is a design-only connector proposal. Essential hosting, current actor and tenant authorization, native service drivers and recovery remain in the free Core. No production interface, publisher trust, installation or effectful capability is established by this metadata.

## Intended scope and evidence

1. Bind routing keys and incident references to an admitted service, tenant and severity mapping.
2. Exercise deduplication, acknowledgement, resolution and out-of-order retries without closing unrelated incidents.
3. Keep provider tokens and diagnostic payloads minimized; qualify outage recovery and make undelivered alerts visible locally.

The complete [acceptance record](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md) defines evidence still required. No checks are marked complete, and no SDK/provider version, target compatibility, release artifact or production entitlement is selected.

## Packaging and licensing decisions

Only this README, the [proposal metadata](package.proposal.json) and [acceptance document](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md) belong to this draft. Executable source, configuration, lifecycle providers and a production manifest must accompany a concrete reviewed implementation later.

The Core license is [AGPL-3.0-only](../../../WCP360_Core/LICENSING.md). This proposal does not choose the connector's license, price, source distribution model, key or vendor URL. A process/API boundary does not automatically permit a proprietary derivative. Review [editions and premium boundaries](../../../documentation/development/EDITIONS-AND-PREMIUM.md) and [plugin lifecycle requirements](../../../documentation/development/PLUGIN-LIFECYCLE.md).
