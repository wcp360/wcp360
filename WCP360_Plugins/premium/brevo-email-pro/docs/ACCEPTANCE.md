# Acceptance record: Brevo transactional email connector

Proposal: `plugin.brevo-email-pro`. State: **design / not installable**. The authoritative entry is in [CATALOG.json](../../CATALOG.json). These are future evidence requirements, not completed tests or a security certification.

## Package-specific and common gates

- [ ] Qualify an admitted API or SMTP profile, verified sender/domain ownership, scoped credentials, consent and bounded recipient/data policies.
- [ ] Authenticate and bind any delivery feedback under a reviewed webhook profile; distinguish request acceptance, delivery, bounce and suppression without guaranteeing deliverability.
- [ ] Exercise provider failure, duplicates, redaction and credential rotation; removal requires an explicit safe route transition and preserved local alerts, not automatic fallback that resends private data.
- [ ] Declare observation-only, import or externally managed ownership before any integration request. Refuse competing writers for Core-owned resources; ownership handoff requires an authorized inventory, admission review and recovery plan.
- [ ] Before implementation, qualify an explicitly selected provider/interface revision, supported compatibility matrix, immutable package provenance, dependency inventory and licensing model; no release is admitted by this proposal.
- [ ] Enforce current Core actor, tenant and capability checks at each admitted request; keep credentials in scoped secret references, redact diagnostics and reject arbitrary destinations, shell commands or host/container sockets.
- [ ] Demonstrate that disablement, removal, provider outage and commercial entitlement loss preserve essential Core access, hosted workloads, local audit and recovery; retain owned data unless a separately authorized purge is requested.

## Evidence to record before qualification

| Evidence | Required record |
| :--- | :--- |
| Provider and interface | Selected service/protocol revision, admitted deployment/account scope and supported capability profile. |
| Core contract | Reviewed SDK/API/use-case revision, current actor/tenant checks and explicit capability boundaries. |
| Compatibility | Qualified Core/package revisions and OS/architecture requirements when relevant; no universal support assumption. |
| Artifact and licensing | Immutable package identity, provenance, dependency inventory, license/source-distribution review and trust decision. |
| Data and credentials | Secret references, disclosure/retention policy, scoped egress, redacted diagnostics and credential rotation/revocation. |
| Recovery | Bounded timeout/retry/queue policy, partial-failure reconciliation, disable/drain and retained-data restore evidence. |
| Verification | Synthetic fixture or isolated target, revision/digests, tools, exact checks, outcomes, unexecuted checks and limitations. |

A successful schema check establishes document shape only. Provider authentication, publisher trust, commercial entitlement, package admission and current Core operation authorization remain separate checks. No arbitrary shell hooks, browser-selected host paths, unreviewed network destinations or host/container sockets are admitted by this proposal.

Installation must begin disabled once an actual installer exists. Removal and provider failure must not block essential local Core administration, hosted workloads or recovery. Uninstall retains owned data by default; a purge requires explicit authorization and a documented recovery decision.
